During the enemy turn, the camera shouldn't move all the way to the left showing dark space

Bugs:
Last dialogue line in a cutscene before the fade out shouldn't disapeer
Peepy portrait in cutscene 5
UI needs to be consistently scaled in each scene, switching from the cutscenes to the map scene is jarring because of this 
Weapon selection before confirming attack
Enemy window shows dead enemy with negative health (not sure if intentional or not)
Able to scroll screen to see the black void where map texture ends
Enemy phase takes time to watch roy end his turn doing nothing instead of just ending enemy phase 
Would like to be able to hold down a direction to move cursor faster
No way to see enemy inventory (unsure if intentional or not)
Add attack range on top of move range
Silly ai mentioned before, about the guard walking through an occupied tile and then walking against a player unit forever, softlocking
Slide screen to cursor on start of player phase instead of teleport
